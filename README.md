Welcome To Kairo, a fully open-source project.
Well, not fully open-source. The API that Kairo will be using will never be open-source.

Kairo will be using Encrypted-Bytes as its host for files. What is Encrypted-Bytes you may ask? Well, Encrypted-Bytes is a secure place to store ysour files.
The max upload size is a massive 100GB and all files are encrypted! (The owner doesn't have/knows the decryption key or even the file extension.)
